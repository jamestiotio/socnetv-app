KNOWN ISSUES
============

- Negative weights break centralities
- UCINET (DL) files in nodelist1 format (one-mode) are not supported.
- SocNetV expects quotes around node labels in pajek formatted files. Pajek files missing opening/closing quotes ("") around node labels cannot be imported correctly (see https://github.com/socnetv/app/issues/73)
