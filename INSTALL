Installation
============

SocNetV is multi-platform, which means that it can be installed and run in every
Operating System supported by the Qt toolkit.

The project offers binaries and installers for the three major Operating Systems:
Windows, MacOS and Linux.

If there is no binary package for your OS, please download and compile the source code,
as explained further below.

Installers & Binaries

You can download an installer or a binary package for your Operating System from the
project's Downloads page: https://socnetv.org/downloads

Follow the instructions below to install it in your system.

Install in Windows

To install SocNetV in Windows, download the latest version from the
Downloads page, and double-click on the SocNetV installer executable.
Click Next and Accept the License (GPL) to install the program.
Afterwards you can find the application in Start > Programs.

Install in MacOS

To install SocNetV in Mac, download the latest SocNetV MacOS installer from
the Downloads page, and double-click on the executable to start the installation.
The application will be installed in your Applications.

Please note that the first time you run SocNetV, you may need to double click on
the SocNetV application icon holding down the META key.

Install in Linux

To run the latest version of SocNetV in Linux, download the latest Linux AppImage from
the project's Downloads page.

Make the file executable and double-click on it to run SocNetV.

Please note that a version of SocNetV is available in the repositories of most Linux distributions.
However that is not always the most recent and updated version.

To install the latest and greatest SocNetV version, users of openSUSE, Fedora and 
Ubuntu/Debian are advised to add our own repositories to their systems.

In Debian and Ubuntu, install SocNetV from our repos with these commands:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dimitris-kalamaras/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install socnetv

In Fedora and openSUSE, choose and add the correct repository from here:
https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Aoxy86&package=socnetv

Once you add the repo, install SocNetV using the command (Fedora):
sudo yum install socnetv

or (openSUSE):
sudo zypper in socnetv


Compile from source code

To compile and install SocNetV from source you need the Qt5 toolkit 
development libraries. Qt is an open source C++ toolkit, for Windows, Linux and MacOS.

Windows and MacOS users should download and install Qt from https://www.qt.io/developers

Linux users need to install the following packages:

openSUSE: libqt5-qtbase, libqt5-qtbase-devel, libQt5Charts5-devel, libqt5-qttools

Fedora: qt5-qtbase,qt5-qtbase-devel, qt5-qtcharts-devel, qt5-qttools

Debian: qt5-default, libqt5charts5-dev

Once you have Qt5 installed, you are ready to compile SocNetV from source.

Download the archive with the source code of the latest version from
https://github.com/socnetv/app/releases/latest, i.e. SocNetV-2.x.tar.gz

Then type in the following commands in order to decompress the
SocNetV tarball and build it. Replace 2.X with the version you downloaded.

1) untar zxfv SocNetV-2.X.tar.gz  (or use 7unzip in Windows/Mac)

2) cd socnetv-2.X

3) qmake

4) make

5) make install # only for linux users, to install socnetv in /usr/local/bin

Probably you have already done the first 2 steps, so just type in 'qmake' or 'qmake-qt5'.

When you finish compiling and installing, run the application typing: 

socnetv
